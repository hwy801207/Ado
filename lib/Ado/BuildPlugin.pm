=head1 NAME

Ado::BuildPlugin - Custom routines for Ado::Plugin::* installation

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    #Ado must be already installed  and
    #Ado::BuildPlugin should be somewhere in @INC
    use Ado::BuildPlugin;
    my $builder = Ado::BuildPlugin->new(..);
    $builder->create_build_script();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a subclass of L<Module::Build>.
We use L<Module::Build::API> to add custom functionality
so we can install Ado  and its plugins in a location chosen by the user.
To use this module for installing your plugins
Build.PL should some how find it in @INC (may be via C<$ENV{PERL5LIB}>).

This module and L<Ado::Build> exist because of the additional install paths
that we use beside C<lib> and C<bin>. These modules also can serve as examples
for your own builders if you have some custom things to do during
build, test, install and even if you need to add a new C<ACTION_*>
to your setup.


=head1 METHODS

Ado::BuildPlugin inherits all methods from L<Module::Build>.
It also imports C<create_build_script>, C<process_etc_files>,
C<process_public_files>, C<process_templates_files> from L<Ado::Build>.
